### Flight Delay Rate Prediction and Analysis
<p>Website: https://boywei.georgetown.domains/Flight_Delay_Analysis/index.html</p>
<p>Tracking the on-time performance of domestic top 30 large airports' flights leads to analysis the potential factors influencing the likelihood of delayness.</p>
<p>Specifically, this project is focusing on gathering, cleaning and analyzing the data of flights, weather and other factors that have potential correlation to the flight delay rate. One of the goals of this project is to evaluate the influence of different factors and formulate an approach to predict the delay rate for any future flights in the United States.</p>
